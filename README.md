# Landing-page
A custom-built webpage based on a provided design template.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to create a responsive and well-styled webpage based on a design specification. The assignment involved recreating a provided design using only HTML and CSS, focusing primarily on Flexbox for layout and alignment. The main objective was to approximate the layout, spacing, and color scheme without focusing on pixel-perfect precision.


# Features and Approach
Responsive Layout Using Flexbox: Leveraged CSS Flexbox to properly structure and align page elements, ensuring a balanced layout across screen sizes.<br>
Custom Content and Images: Substituted original content and images for the placeholders to give the page a personalized touch.<br>
Color and Font Matching: The color scheme and font styles were carefully selected to closely follow the provided design. Minor adjustments were made to enhance readability and overall visual appeal.<br>
Flexible Spacing and Alignment: Focused on achieving a visually balanced look through Flexbox, allowing for slight spacing adjustments to maintain a clean and professional appearance.<br>
CSS Styling Techniques: Rounded corners, shadows, and other styling features were applied to enhance the page's modern look.<br>
# Technology Used
HTML5: For structuring the content<br>
CSS3: For styling and responsive layout using Flexbox<br>
# Challenges and Solutions
Flexbox Layout Adjustments: Flexbox was essential for achieving the specified layout. Some trial and error were required to match the design while keeping the layout responsive.<br>
Font and Color Selection: In instances where exact specifications were not provided, I referred to Google Fonts and color-matching tools to replicate the look and feel.<br>
Responsive Design: Implemented media queries to ensure the layout adjusts smoothly on different screen sizes.<br>
